The adding of blocks on the blockchain is simply insertion into a
linked list therefore the time complexity is O(1).  Space complexity will
depend on the number of characters in the string as this is stored in the
data property of each block.  Whether integers are entered
into the value passed to the blockchain is irrelevant as the value is converted
to a string therefore this will not affect space complexity.
To display the linked list the list in looped, this having a space and time complexity
of O(N).  Worst case scenario is therefore O(N).
