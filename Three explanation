I am firstly looping the characters and pushing to a dictionary
which is O(n).
Secondly I am using a merge sort to sort the items from the dictionary
which is n log2 n.
I am then looping through the sorted data and pushing to a heap, O(n).
Thirdly I am initializing the tree which involves looping data
O(n) and popping two items from the heap O(2 log n) and pushing back
into the heap O(log n).
Lastly, I am carrying out another loop to replace the original string
with the encoded characters O(n).
I therefore believe the worst case scenario is O(n log n).

The worst case scenario of decoding I believe is On ^ 2 due to
having a nested loop.
