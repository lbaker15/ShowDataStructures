Explanation
For this problem I call a function which loops the existing directories,
appending any files that contain the suffix and recalling the function
for any nested directories.  I used a recursive function as this meant
it wasn't necessary to call any nested loops thus improving time complexity.

Time Complexity
I first loop throughout the directories which runs on linear time
O(n*6) or O(n).
I then call a recursive function which passes in the current directory
in the loop, this also runs on linear time O(n).
Therefore I believe the worst case scenario would be O(n) dependent on
the depth and number of nested directories at each directory/level.

Space Complexity
Space complexity will depend on the depth of the input so if d is depth
O(d).
